Begin by engaging the Information Security & Data Privacy expert to address the privacy and regulatory risks prominently flagged in the project, especially those related to GDPR compliance and consent management. Given the early integration tasks, concurrently bring in the IT Systems & Data Platforms expert to ensure robust data source consolidation from systems like MyBMW App and ConnectedDrive. These discussions are foundational due to the project's focus on establishing a seamless customer-data platform, as outlined for the PoC phase in the DACH market.\n\nOnce these technical and legal frameworks are secure, proceed with the CRM & Dealer Systems specialist who can facilitate the integration between dealer CRM systems and marketing automation tools. This step is crucial as it directly supports the project's goal of creating a real-time data flow, enhancing lead prioritization and conversion rates. Following this, the AI & Data Science expert should be involved to build and operationalize predictive models. These models will enable the personalized marketing strategies essential for achieving a 15% increase in conversion rates.\n\nApproach these engagements strategically, focusing on risk mitigation and clear communication of project phases. Initial conversations should aim to validate data integration timelines while concurrently identifying potential legal constraints to avoid future roadblocks. By aligning technical capabilities with business goals early on, you set a solid foundation for the project's global rollout ambitions, ensuring seamless marketing, sales, and customer experience integration across all touchpoints."
