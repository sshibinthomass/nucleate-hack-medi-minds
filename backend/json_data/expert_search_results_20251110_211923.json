  "roadmap": "We identified six critical expertise areas for the BMW Connected Experience Hub project. Begin by contacting the IT Systems and Data Integration experts, as the project's immediate needs require establishing a robust central customer data platform. According to the document, this is fundamental for integrating MyBMW App and dealer portals, which is essential for the Proof of Concept (PoC) planned with BMW Marketing and Retail Next. Following this, engage Legal and Compliance specialists to address flagged data privacy risks and DSGVO compliance concerns. It's crucial to ensure that all data flows adhere to legal standards, particularly given the project's emphasis on personalized advertising and consent management.\n\nOnce the foundational technical and legal framework is in place, shift focus to CRM Architecture and Sales Operations professionals. Their expertise will facilitate seamless integration between the central CX Hub, dealer CRM, and BMW’s Marketing Cloud, aligning with the project's goals of enhancing real-time data availability for sales optimizations. Midway through the project, bring in experts in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science to design and implement AI models that will drive personalized customer experiences and sales forecasts. As the project approaches pilot and rollout stages, engage Marketing and Retail Operations experts to ensure effective tool adoption, campaign integration, and KPI tracking, specifically targeting the DACH market.\n\nApproach these engagements with clear objectives and a collaborative mindset. Begin dialogues with risk mitigation and project timeline validation in mind. Each interaction should be anchored in the specific project requirements and goals, ensuring that all parties understand the dependencies and sequencing essential for the project’s success."
